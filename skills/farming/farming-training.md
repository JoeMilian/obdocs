# Farming Training

**Before you start:** Decide what tier of compost you want to use. Ultracompost is definitely worth obtaining if you plan on doing any serious farming.  
Use: `+defaultfarming tier ultracompost` before you start doing any farming and make sure to keep up on supply. At a bare minimum use supercompost, as it's very easy to get through pvm or the +compostbin command.

Ultra compost can be obtained by mining volcanic ash and combining with super compost.  
`+mine volcanic ash`  
`+create ultracompost`
